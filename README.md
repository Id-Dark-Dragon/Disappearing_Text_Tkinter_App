# Project Title


**The Most Dangerous Writing App** is a simple desktop application built using *CostumeTkinter* in Python. 

This app provides a unique writing experience where you need to keep typing to prevent the text from disappearing. If you stop typing, the text will be removed after a countdown.

- Package-Based Structure
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
